### User Pain Points
1. Grip with thumb is fatiguing
2. Hard edges dig into hand
3. Crank is only usable for right handed people
4. Crank is too small/uncomfortable
5. Opening faces side of grater requiring awkward angle

### Market Analysis
There are some products already on the market which address these pain points, usually called “Cheese
Mills”, but they have their own functional and ergonomic issues.


#### Microplane

>“...can only put in a **very small amount of
cheese**. It has to be refilled if more than one
person is dining.”

#### Cuisinart
>“**Broke after a week’s use**--plastic
cracked... Not very well designed.
Cuisinart used to be a reputable brand--
this just felt like a piece of Chinese junk.”

#### Westmark
>“this grater is **difficult to use**. It requires the user to push down quite hard while you turn
the top handle.”
